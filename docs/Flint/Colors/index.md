# Colors

**class Colors**



This class defined a good set of ANSI colors.

!!! tip
    
    It is recomended to use those through streams :
    std::cout << Flint::Colors::GREEN << "Hacker time" << Flint::Colors::RESET << std::endl;

!!! info
    
    Please **ALWAYS** remember to close your colors with Flint::Colors::RESET.
    Failure to do si might result in broken displays, with weird colors everywhere
